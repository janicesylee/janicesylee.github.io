The **Chewing Robot** was developed as part of a robotic art performance to challenge conventional perceptions of robotics by simulating an action that robots are unlikely to performâ€”chewing and "eating" food. The project aimed to explore the expressive potential of robotics through the intricate and coordinated motion of the jaw and neck, combining biomechanics with artistic storytelling.

I contributed to the design and fabrication of the robotic jaw mechanism, focusing on its actuation and control. The final system effectively captured key chewing dynamics and was showcased as a medium for art. This project expanded my expertise in mechanical design, control systems, and the creative application of robotics.
