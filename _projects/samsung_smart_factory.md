I worked as a **Robotics Software Intern** with the **Smart Factory Robotics Software Team** at Samsung Electronics from **June 2023 to August 2023**. 

This project showcases the integration of a **Robotiq three-finger gripper** with Samsung's industrial 6 DOF robotic arm, aimed at enhancing smart manufacturing processes through improved adaptability. The following sections outline the core components of the project.

- **Custom Hardware Design:** Developed a secure, durable gripper mount to attach the Robotiq gripper to the robotic arm.
- **Ethernet Communication Protocol:** Established a communication interface for controlling the gripper directly from the manipulator's control box.
- **Control Software Development:** Implemented user-friendly control functions to facilitate accurate and intuitive pick-and-place operations.

These upgrades improved precision, adaptability, and efficiency, enabling the robotic arm to handle a wider range of objects and perform more complex tasks. This work strengthened my expertise in modular hardware design, real-time communication protocols, and user-centered robotics software. It also demonstrated the potential for adaptive robotic solutions to optimize smart factory operations and laid the groundwork for future gripper research work.
