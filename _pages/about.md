I am a recent graduate (Masters in Robotics) from Carnegie Mellon University, Robotics Institute. I worked on compliant gripper design and visual servoing controller for an autonomous robotic system developed for cornstalk monitoring, co-advised by Oliver Kroemer and George Kantor.

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University (B.S) in Mechanical Engineering. Previously I interned at Smith+Nephew Robotics and Samsung Electronics Global Research Center.
