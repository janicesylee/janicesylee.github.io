I am a research assistant at the <a href='https://iamlab-cmu.github.io/'>Intelligent Autonomous Manipulation Lab</a>, Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I recently earned a Master of Science in Robotics from CMU, where I focused on developing a compliant gripper design and visual servoing controller for an autonomous robotic system designed for cornstalk monitoring. My research was co-advised by Professors Oliver Kroemer and George Kantor.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a double major in Robotics from CMU. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained practical experience through internships at Smith+Nephew Robotics and Samsung Electronics Global Research Center.
